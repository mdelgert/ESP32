To create an image that does not require decoding (i.e., raw pixel data), you need to convert your image to a raw format that your display can directly interpret. For most TFT displays, this format is typically **RGB565**, which uses 16 bits (2 bytes) per pixel.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how you can convert an image to raw RGB565 format:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Image
First, choose or create the image that you want to display. Make sure it matches the dimensions of your TFT screen (in this case, 160x80).

### Step 2: Convert the Image to RGB565 Format
You can use tools like **ImageMagick**, **GIMP**, or a dedicated online converter to convert your image to the RGB565 format. Here’s how you can do it using different methods:

#### Using **ImageMagick** (Command Line Tool):
1. Install ImageMagick from [here](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) if you don’t have it installed.
2. Run the following command to convert the image to raw RGB565 format:
   ```bash
   convert input_image.png -depth 16 -size 160x80 rgb:output_image.raw
   ```
   Replace `input_image.png` with the path to your image and adjust `160x80` to match the dimensions of your screen.

#### Using **GIMP** (GUI Tool):
1. Open your image in GIMP.
2. Resize the image to match your display size (160x80 in your case).
3. Go to **Image** > **Mode** > **RGB**.
4. Export the image:
   - Go to **File** > **Export As**.
   - Choose **Raw Image Data** as the export format and make sure it is 16-bit.
   - Save it with a `.raw` extension.

### Step 3: Convert the Raw Image Data into a C Array
Once you have the raw `.raw` file, you’ll need to convert it into a C array that can be used in your Arduino code. There are online tools and scripts that can help with this. Here's how you can do it using a simple Python script.

#### Python Script to Convert `.raw` to a C Array:
```python
import struct

# Read the raw image file
with open("output_image.raw", "rb") as f:
    data = f.read()

# Convert to 16-bit (2-byte) RGB565 format and output as a C array
with open("image.h", "w") as f:
    f.write("const uint16_t gImage_logo[] = {\n")
    
    for i in range(0, len(data), 2):
        # Convert two bytes at a time
        pixel = struct.unpack('H', data[i:i+2])[0]
        f.write(f"0x{pixel:04X}, ")
        
        # Add a newline every 16 values for readability
        if i % 32 == 30:
            f.write("\n")

    f.write("};\n")
```

### Step 4: Include the Image in Your Arduino Sketch
Once you have the `image.h` file (or whichever name you use), you can include it in your Arduino sketch just like your original `logo.h` file.

```cpp
#include "TFT_eSPI.h"
#include "image.h"  // Your generated image file

TFT_eSPI tft = TFT_eSPI();

void setup() {
  tft.init();
  tft.setRotation(3);
  tft.fillScreen(TFT_BLACK);

  // Display the image
  tft.pushImage(0, 0, 160, 80, gImage_logo); // Use your converted image array
}

void loop() {
  // Your code here
}
```

### Summary of Steps:
1. **Resize** your image to match the dimensions of your TFT display.
2. **Convert** it to raw RGB565 format (using ImageMagick, GIMP, or other tools).
3. Use a **script** (e.g., in Python) to convert the raw data into a C array.
4. **Include** the C array in your Arduino code and display it using `pushImage()`.

This process ensures that your image is in a format directly compatible with the TFT screen, allowing you to display it without requiring any decoding.
