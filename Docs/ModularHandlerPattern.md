The coding pattern you've implemented and described follows the **Modular Handler Pattern**. It is commonly used in embedded systems and structured software development for managing functionality in a clean, extensible, and reusable manner. Here's a breakdown of its characteristics and how you can describe it in the future:

### **Key Characteristics of the Modular Handler Pattern**
1. **Encapsulation**:
   - Each functional unit (e.g., SD card handling, Wi-Fi management) is encapsulated in its own module or "handler."
   - This keeps the implementation details hidden from other parts of the code, exposing only an interface (e.g., `init`, `update`, or `maintain` methods).

2. **Centralized Control**:
   - The `setup` function serves as a centralized place to initialize all handlers in a predictable sequence.
   - The `loop` function calls the necessary update or maintenance methods, keeping the main sketch clean and focused on the application flow.

3. **Reusability**:
   - Each handler is self-contained and can be reused across multiple projects without modifications to the main application logic.

4. **Extensibility**:
   - New functionality can be added by creating new handlers without altering existing ones.
   - For example, adding a `TemperatureHandler` or `LoggingHandler` requires minimal changes to the `setup` and `loop` functions.

5. **Feature Toggle Support**:
   - Handlers can be conditionally included or initialized based on feature flags or configuration settings, improving modularity and runtime flexibility.

6. **Code Organization**:
   - Clear separation of concerns makes it easier to manage and debug specific functionality.

### **Advantages**
- **Scalability**: Easily add new features without altering existing code.
- **Maintainability**: Each handler can be modified independently, minimizing the risk of introducing bugs in unrelated parts of the code.
- **Readability**: Centralized `setup` and `loop` logic simplifies understanding the overall application flow.
- **Testability**: Handlers can be tested in isolation, ensuring robust functionality.

### **Example of How to Describe This Pattern**

- **Name**: Modular Handler Pattern
- **Purpose**: To create a scalable, maintainable, and reusable architecture for embedded systems and software projects.
- **Usage**:
  - Divide application functionality into separate "handlers," each responsible for managing a specific feature (e.g., SD card, LED, Wi-Fi).
  - Use consistent methods like `init`, `update`, and `maintain` for lifecycle management.
  - Keep the `setup` and `loop` functions clean and focused on initialization and periodic updates.

### **Comparison to Design Patterns**
- **Similarities to Object-Oriented Principles**:
  - Encapsulation (each handler manages its own data and behavior).
  - Abstraction (the main application interacts with handlers through well-defined methods).

- **Influence of Component-Based Architecture**:
  - Each handler behaves like a "component" that interacts with the system in a loosely coupled manner.

When discussing this pattern, you can reference it as the **Modular Handler Pattern** or describe it as **a modular approach to embedded system design** emphasizing encapsulation, reusability, and extensibility.
