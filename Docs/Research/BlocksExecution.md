Yes, it is **best practice to avoid using `delay()`** in your code whenever possible, especially in microcontroller projects like those on Arduino or ESP32. 

Hereâ€™s why:

---

### **Why `delay()` Is Not Recommended**
1. **Blocks Execution**:
   - `delay()` halts all program execution for the specified duration.
   - During this time, the microcontroller **cannot perform any other tasks**, such as:
     - Monitoring inputs (buttons, sensors, etc.).
     - Handling communication (like USB, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth).
     - Running other parts of your program (state machines, animations, etc.).

2. **Inefficient for Real-Time Systems**:
   - Real-time systems often require multitasking (even if pseudo-multitasking).
   - `delay()` prevents this, as it monopolizes the CPU for a single operation.

3. **Poor Scalability**:
   - Using `delay()` makes your program unresponsive and harder to extend.
   - Adding multiple features becomes difficult since each `delay()` introduces unwanted pauses.

4. **Non-Interrupt-Friendly**:
   - During a `delay()`, interrupts still work, but handling those interrupts effectively becomes trickier when the main program is "paused."

### **Better Alternatives to `delay()`**
Instead of `delay()`, use **non-blocking delays** with **`millis()`** or **timers** to achieve time-based functionality while keeping your program responsive.

---

#### **1. Using `millis()` for Non-Blocking Delays**
The `millis()` function tracks the time since the program started. You can use it to schedule tasks without halting execution.

Example: Send data or perform an action at regular intervals.
```cpp
unsigned long previousMillis = 0; // Tracks the last time an action occurred
const unsigned long interval = 1000; // Interval of 1 second (1000 ms)

void loop() {
  unsigned long currentMillis = millis();
  
  if (currentMillis - previousMillis >= interval) {
    previousMillis = currentMillis; // Update the timer

    // Perform the action
    Serial.println("Action executed without blocking!");
  }

  // Add other tasks here that run continuously
}
```

---

#### **2. State Machines**
State machines allow you to divide complex tasks into states, where transitions occur based on conditions or timing. This keeps the program responsive.

Example:
```cpp
enum State { IDLE, SENDING, DONE };
State currentState = IDLE;
unsigned long startTime;

void loop() {
  switch (currentState) {
    case IDLE:
      startTime = millis();
      currentState = SENDING;
      break;

    case SENDING:
      if (millis() - startTime >= 1000) { // Wait 1 second
        Serial.println("Action Completed!");
        currentState = DONE;
      }
      break;

    case DONE:
      // Do nothing or reset state
      break;
  }

  // Other tasks can run concurrently
}
```

---

#### **3. Hardware Timers**
Many microcontrollers (like ESP32) offer **hardware timers** that trigger tasks asynchronously, making them ideal for precise, non-blocking timing.

Example for ESP32:
```cpp
#include "esp_timer.h"

void onTimer(void* arg) {
  Serial.println("Timer triggered!");
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);

  esp_timer_create_args_t timer_args = {
    .callback = &onTimer,
    .name = "example_timer"
  };

  esp_timer_handle_t timer;
  esp_timer_create(&timer_args, &timer);
  esp_timer_start_periodic(timer, 1000000); // Trigger every 1 second
}

void loop() {
  // Main code remains responsive
}
```

---

### **Summary**
- **Avoid `delay()`**: It blocks execution and makes the program unresponsive.
- **Use `millis()`** for non-blocking delays to allow multitasking.
- For complex timing or multitasking:
   - Use **state machines** for structured control.
   - Use **hardware timers** for high precision and efficiency.

By avoiding `delay()` and using these alternatives, your program will be **responsive**, efficient, and easier to maintain. ðŸš€
