In the `LogManager` implementation, messages are **suppressed** when the message's log level is lower than the configured global `LM_LEVEL`. Let's break this down:

### Key Mechanism for Suppressing Logs

The `log` method checks the **level** of the log message against the configured `LM_LEVEL` before proceeding. If the message's level is below the `LM_LEVEL`, it is ignored:

```cpp
static void log(const String& message, LogLevel level = LM_LEVEL_INFO) {
    if (level < currentLogLevel) {
        return; // Skip messages below the current log level
    }

    // Logging logic for Serial, TFT, and MQTT follows here...
}
```

### How It Works

1. **Defined Log Level in `Config.h`:**
   ```cpp
   #define LM_LEVEL LM_LEVEL_INFO
   ```
   - This specifies the global log level. For example, if `LM_LEVEL` is `LM_LEVEL_INFO`, the logger will only process messages at `LM_LEVEL_INFO` or higher (`WARN`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`).

2. **Log Levels Enum:**
   ```cpp
   enum LogLevel {
        LM_LEVEL_TRACE,
        LM_LEVEL_DEBUG,
        LM_LEVEL_INFO,
        LM_LEVEL_WARN,
        LM_LEVEL_ERROR,
        LM_LEVEL_CRITICAL
    };
   ```
   - Log levels have increasing values, so you can compare their importance using `<` or `>=`.

3. **Suppressing Logs:**
   - Suppose the current `LM_LEVEL` is `LM_LEVEL_INFO` (value `2`).
   - If you log a message with `LM_LEVEL_DEBUG` (value `1`), the condition `if (level < currentLogLevel)` evaluates to `true`, and the log is skipped.
   - For `LM_LEVEL_WARN` (value `3`), the condition evaluates to `false`, so the message is logged.

### Example in Action

#### `Config.h`:
```cpp
#define LM_LEVEL LM_LEVEL_WARN
```

#### Logging Messages:
```cpp
LogManager::log("This is a TRACE log", LM_LEVEL_TRACE);   // Suppressed if LM_LEVEL > TRACE
LogManager::log("This is a DEBUG log", LM_LEVEL_DEBUG);   // Suppressed if LM_LEVEL > DEBUG
LogManager::log("This is an INFO log", LM_LEVEL_INFO);    // Logged if LM_LEVEL <= INFO
LogManager::log("This is a WARN log", LM_LEVEL_WARN);     // Logged if LM_LEVEL <= WARN
LogManager::log("This is an ERROR log", LM_LEVEL_ERROR);  // Always logged if LM_LEVEL <= ERROR
LogManager::log("This is a CRITICAL log", LM_LEVEL_CRITICAL); // Always logged

```

- **Suppressed Logs:** Messages with levels `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, or `INFO` are not logged because their level is below the configured `LM_LEVEL_WARN`.
- **Processed Logs:** Messages with levels `WARN`, `ERROR`, or `CRITICAL` are logged because their level meets or exceeds the configured `LM_LEVEL`.

### Why Use This Mechanism?

1. **Performance Optimization:** Prevents unnecessary processing of verbose logs (`TRACE` or `DEBUG`) in production.
2. **Configurable Behavior:** Developers can adjust the `LM_LEVEL` in `Config.h` based on the deployment environment:
   - Use `LM_LEVEL_DEBUG` during development for detailed logs.
   - Use `LM_LEVEL_WARN` or higher in production to focus on issues. 

This mechanism ensures that the log output remains concise and relevant without modifying the source code.

Here are the best practices for implementing log levels in your `WiFiHandler` class using the `LogManager`:

### Key Considerations for Log Levels

1. **Log Severity**: Use appropriate log levels to reflect the severity and importance of messages. 
   - **Trace**: Highly detailed information, typically for debugging purposes.
   - **Debug**: Information useful for diagnosing issues or tracking the flow.
   - **Info**: General information about operations.
   - **Warning**: Non-critical issues that may require attention.
   - **Error**: Critical issues that may affect the functionality.
   - **Critical**: Catastrophic issues requiring immediate action.

2. **Avoid Log Spam**: Avoid logging frequently in loops or for routine checks unless using low log levels like `Trace` or `Debug`.

3. **User Visibility**: Logs at `Info` and higher should indicate significant events that a user might care about (e.g., connection success or failure).

### Suggested Log Level Assignments in `WiFiHandler`

#### Initialization (`init`)
- **Info**: Log significant steps of initialization (e.g., starting Wi-Fi, hostname setting).
- **Error**: Log failure to set hostname or connect after retries.

Example:
```cpp
LogManager::log("Initializing Wi-Fi...", LM_LEVEL_INFO);
if (!WiFi.setHostname(hostname.c_str())) {
    LogManager::log("Failed to set hostname: " + hostname, LM_LEVEL_ERROR);
} else {
    LogManager::log("Hostname set to: " + hostname, LM_LEVEL_INFO);
}
```

#### Connection Attempt (`reconnect`)
- **Debug**: Log each connection retry and status updates.
- **Warning**: Log when retries are failing and exponential backoff is applied.
- **Info**: Log successful reconnection.

Example:
```cpp
LogManager::log("Reconnecting to Wi-Fi...", LM_LEVEL_DEBUG);
while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED && retries > 0) {
    LogManager::log("Retrying Wi-Fi connection...", LM_LEVEL_DEBUG);
    delay(500);
    retries--;
}
if (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    LogManager::log("Reconnect failed. Next attempt in " + String(reconnectDelay / 1000) + " seconds.", LM_LEVEL_WARN);
} else {
    LogManager::log("Wi-Fi reconnected successfully.", LM_LEVEL_INFO);
}
```

#### Status Logging (`logStatus`)
- **Info**: Log when the device is connected.
- **Debug**: Log detailed information like IP address or network information.
- **Warning**: Log when the device is not connected.

Example:
```cpp
if (WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED) {
    LogManager::log("Wi-Fi connected: " + WiFi.localIP().toString(), LM_LEVEL_INFO);
} else {
    LogManager::log("Wi-Fi not connected.", LM_LEVEL_WARN);
}
```

#### Disconnect (`disconnect`)
- **Info**: Log when Wi-Fi is intentionally disconnected.
- **Debug**: Log additional context if necessary (e.g., reason for disconnection).

Example:
```cpp
LogManager::log("Wi-Fi disconnected.", LM_LEVEL_INFO);
```

#### Maintain Connection (`maintain`)
- **Debug**: Log periodic checks for connection.
- **Warning**: Log when the device is not connected and attempting to recover.

Example:
```cpp
if (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    LogManager::log("Wi-Fi disconnected, attempting to reconnect...", LM_LEVEL_WARN);
    reconnect();
}
```

### Full Integration with Log Levels

Here's a snippet integrating log levels:

```cpp
// Initialization
LogManager::log("Initializing Wi-Fi...", LM_LEVEL_INFO);

// Reconnection
LogManager::log("Reconnecting to Wi-Fi...", LM_LEVEL_DEBUG);
while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED && retries > 0) {
    LogManager::log("Retrying Wi-Fi connection...", LM_LEVEL_DEBUG);
    delay(500);
    retries--;
}

if (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    LogManager::log("Reconnect failed. Next attempt in " + String(reconnectDelay / 1000) + " seconds.", LM_LEVEL_WARN);
} else {
    LogManager::log("Wi-Fi reconnected successfully.", LM_LEVEL_INFO);
}

// Status Check
if (WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED) {
    LogManager::log("Wi-Fi connected: " + WiFi.localIP().toString(), LM_LEVEL_INFO);
} else {
    LogManager::log("Wi-Fi not connected.", LM_LEVEL_WARN);
}

// Disconnect
LogManager::log("Wi-Fi disconnected.", LM_LEVEL_INFO);
```

### Best Practices Summary
1. **Granularity**: Use `Trace` and `Debug` for internal processes (e.g., retries, periodic checks). Use `Info` for significant events (e.g., connection success). Use `Warn` and `Error` for failure states.
2. **Conditional Logs**: Suppress low-level logs in production by setting an appropriate `LM_LEVEL` in `Config.h`.
3. **Reduce Redundancy**: Avoid excessive logging in loops unless debugging (`Debug` level).
4. **Focus on Recovery**: Highlight recovery attempts and failures (`Warn` or `Error`) to assist in troubleshooting.

By following these best practices, your `WiFiHandler` will provide meaningful and context-aware logs while avoiding excessive verbosity.
